# computer_security_rsa
This is COMP8760 (2021-22) A1: Programming Assignment

### The Code

This code is written in Python 3.10 (using PyCharm IDE)

### Running The Code
*To run the code, open the terminal and go to the directory where the code resides and run the code files individually.
For example to run as2634_task1.py
 python as2634_task1.py


*The files are self-contained and all necessary libraries are imported.


### What is in the code
-The files contain :

-as2634_task1 contains Naive RSA encryption system implementation.

-as2634_task2 contains Goldwasser-Micali encryption system implementation.

-as2634_task3a contains the image proof of an example input-output demonstrating the insecurity of Naive RSA with respect to an IND-CPA adversary.

-as2634_task3b contains the image proof of an example input-output demonstrating the security of the Goldwasser-Micali encryption scheme with respect to an IND-CPA adversary

-as2634_task4a contains the proof that Naive RSA is insecure with respect to an IND-CCA

-as2634_task4b contains the proof that Goldwasser-Micali encryption scheme is insecure with respect to an IND-CCA adversary.
